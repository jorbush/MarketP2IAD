--- The interaction protocols


--- Experiments and results

	We have based the tests on the variation in the number of collectors. 
	This is because we think it is the easiest value to make variable with a slider because the collectors, which at the beginning there are always 4 collectors, set their preferences randomly (the maximum price they are able to pay and the author they prefer).

	-- Experiments with one collector

		Each collector can get as maximum two paintings, because there are two art galleries that contact with them. 
		As we can see in this picture, there are only two paintings sold (two squares in gray).

	-- Experiments with six collectors

		More collectors means more probability to sell paintings, which means better performance of the market.
		As we can see in this picture, there are more squares with colour gray, which means that the art galleries have sold more paintings than the previous experiment.


--- Analyses and conclusions of the experiments you carried out. 

	The global behaviour matches with our expectations because we have designed a market between art galleries and collectors that communicates through message passing, with economic transactions when a collector buys a painting and even with the ability to negotiate according to his preferences. And all this is represented in the interface, with the limitations of NetLogo.

	With these simulations we have learned the importance of reaching the maximum number of clients in a market and matching their preferences to the products you have. In the beginning, when we had not implemented yet that the art gallery asked for the collector's preferences, when the collector said he was not interested, sales were much lower.

	In conclusion, the performance of our market is higher when there are more collectors.
